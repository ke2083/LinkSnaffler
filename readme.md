LinkSnaffler

A handy c# command line tool for hoovering up all the links on a site, checking their status and reporting on variants (URLs that differ only by query string) and link-backs.

Usage

Run the utility, type in the URL and let it fly.  It'll produce an XML report that you can read or query with something like XML Spy.
